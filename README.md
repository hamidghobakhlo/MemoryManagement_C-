# Program Explanation

This program is designed to monitor the memory status of a Windows system. Below are the explanations of the different sections of the code:

## Libraries:

- **windows.h**: Provides access to Windows system functions like `GlobalMemoryStatusEx`, which retrieves memory information.
- **stdlib.h**: Includes standard library functions for general purposes.
- **Winnetwk.h**: Used to access network and system status functions.

## Data Structures:

- **MEMORYSTATUSEX**: This structure contains information about the physical and virtual memory status of the system. It includes details like total physical memory, used physical memory, total virtual memory, and available memory.

## Functions:

- **GlobalMemoryStatusEx**: A function that populates the `MEMORYSTATUSEX` structure with memory status information. This includes the total and available physical and virtual memory, memory load, and the percentage of memory in use.

## Memory Load Calculation:

- The program first retrieves the physical and virtual memory information. Then, the used memory is calculated by subtracting the available memory from the total memory.
- The memory load percentage is obtained directly from the `dwMemoryLoad` field in the `MEMORYSTATUSEX` structure and returned.

## Displaying Information:

- The program displays information about the total and used physical and virtual memory, along with the memory load percentage.

## Summary:

In summary, this program is designed to monitor the memory status of a Windows system and provides important information regarding the usage of both physical and virtual memory.
